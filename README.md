## Todos

Keep in mind this Expo thing is in debug mode.

Would be good to use Lunr which is like Solr but for client-side searching so would allow faceted search. My implementation was too slow but I didn't spend that much time on it. Probably could have added a good preloading index approach to make it quicker if had to do from scratch.

Also, could do momentum-based scroll animation so the header animation more naturally moves with the scroll momentum. I think I could do this but didn't want to spend more time.

Also, I prefer to focus heavy on components that are prebuilt for UI so styling is at a minimum.

Either way, I'll go with the flow of the team as usual.
